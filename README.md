Hi, I'm sergegoldstein@gmail.com . 

I retired from Princeton University in 2020 after 33 years in the IT department.  I started my career as as assembler language systems programmer (IBM system 360/370),
then went on to do Unix system's programming, and finally ended up running a web development group.  I've developed a number of open source applications over the years, 
including **WASE** (formerly named OH), an office-hours scheduling application which became the standard for scheduling faculty-student meetings at Princeton, 
supporting upwards of 100,000 appointments per year.  WASE is being retired this year at Princeton, because it has no support community.  

I will be uploading WASE to Github (it was built using an ECL 2 license) in the hope that other institutions will find it useful.
